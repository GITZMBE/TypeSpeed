### WPM 
Total number of characters in the correctly typed words (including spaces), divided by 5 and normalized to 60 seconds.

### Raw WPM 
Calculated just like WPM, but also includes incorrect words.

### Accuracy (Acc)
Percentage of correctly pressed keys.

### Char Ratio
Ratio of correct characters to incorrect characters. Calculated after the test has ended.

### Consistency
Based on the variance of your raw WPM. Closer to 100% is better. Calculated using the coefficient of variation of raw WPM and mapped onto a scale from 0 to 100.
